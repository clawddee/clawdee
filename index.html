		<p>
		Welcome to 8bitplants! This site is a little miss mash of things I enjoy. I like 8bit and pixel art a deal. It’s one of my favorite 
digital art forms, and I have a love for plants and virtual pet sites. This website, has information on native plants, mostly in the eastern U.S. 
however I would like to add much more as time goes on. <p>
			There is a small section of little 8bit plants that can be “adopted.” Meaning, 
there is a code underneath each one that can be Copy&Pasted to your preferred website. I also have a small plant care section that I will be posting 
tips I’ve learned over the years. This is an ongoing project, one that I hope to be working on for years to come. </p>
