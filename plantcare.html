	<p><h3> Pest Lookout: Mealybugs </h3></p>

<p>Mealybugs: Mealies are awful little white bugs. From a distance they look like little cotton balls on the plant. Once you get up close, you can them 
moving around and looking a little more buggy. They tend to hide on the underside of plant leaves and in little nooks. They will 
also leave residue behind that looks like little spots of snow or white mold on the plant.
Please be warned, mealybugs can get out of control, and if a plant is too far gone, it may be best to say farewell. 
If you catch the infestation in the early stages, use a cotton swab dabbed in rubbing alcohol.
	<br><strong>Test a leaf on your plant a day or two before. 
The alcohol could burn the plant, and do not use anything over 70%. </strong> <br>
	Dab it directly on the mealy bugs and their residue to kill them quickly. 
Check the entire plant and eliminate whatever you find. Continue this process once to twice a week for around a month. I would do a weekly check after 
that to see if the the problem is truly gone or not. Be care with over-watering, they love soft/wet soil and plants with high nitrogen levels.</p>

<p>You can also use neem oil, and wipe the leaves down. <br>
	<strong> Neem oil can harm monarchs, and their larvae. Use with caution with outdoor plants, 
especially with milkweed. </strong> <br>
	Making sure to get as much of plant as possible. Mealy bugs love to hide in hard to get areas. If you mealy bugs
are outside, plant dill, fennel, cilantro, yarrow, scented geraniums, or cosmos to help attract ladybugs. Ladybugs are predators of mealybugs and will 
happily eat them up. Beware of ants, they eat the honeydew that mealybugs produce and will protect them from predators. You maybe have to set up a war 
zone if your infestation is bad.</p>
